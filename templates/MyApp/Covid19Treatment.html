                    <p>India is currently reeling under the impact of the second wave of 
                    COVID-19 pandemic that has led to an alarming surge in daily cases. Amid 
                    the massive surge in the COVID-19 cases across India, people are looking 
                    out for tips on self-care and treatment options for people severely affected 
                    by COVID-19 disease.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>While scientists worldwide are working to find and develop treatments for 
                    COVID-19, optimal supportive care includes antiviral drugs and other drugs, 
                    including plasma therapy. Other supportive care for severely ill patients 
                    includes oxygen for those at risk for severe disease and advanced respiratory 
                    support like ventilation for critically ill patients.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Treatment options for COVID-19</h2>  
                    <p>Here are some of the medicines doctors use for people hospitalized with COVID-19.</p>
                    <h3>Remdesivir</h3>
                    <p>The FDA approved remdesivir, an antiviral drug, in October 2020 to treat coronavirus
                     infection. The green signal was given based on the data that indicated that a select 
                     group of hospitalized pateints who were  administered remdesivir showed improvement 
                     in their symptoms and recovered faster. In India, the DCGI (Drug Controller General 
                     of India) approved remdesivir lyophilized (in powder form) for emergency treatment 
                     of hospitalized people.The drug can be given to children above the age of 12,
                      weighing a minimum of 40 kgs, and adults, provided they have been hospitalized.</p>
                    <h3>Dexamethasone</h3> 
                    <p>Since the pandemic started, doctors have been using corticosteroids to treat critically 
                    ill COVID-19-infected people. This drug is effective for people experiencing a cytokine 
                    storm (hyper-immune reaction). In such cases, the hyperactive immune system of a person 
                    damages the lungs and other body parts, often leading to life-threatening complications.
                    Dexamethasone and similar corticosteroids make potent anti-inflammatory medication choices. 
                    These are easily available and reasonably priced.</p>
                    <h3>Baricitinib with Remdesivir</h3> 
                    <p>According to a clinical trial, baricitinib and remdesivir make a promising combination 
                    when treating COVID-19. Baricitinib is an anti-inflammatory medicine. When it is combined 
                    with remdesivir, it helps reduce the recovery time in hospitalized people. While the 
                    combination shows positive results, more clinical studies are needed.</p>
                    <h3>Anticoagulation Drugs or Blood Thinners</h3>  
                    <p>Most people who need hospitalization for COVID-19 treatment get medications to prevent 
                    blood clots. According to a recent study, preventive blood thinners are likely to reduce 
                    fatalities in COVID cases.</p>
                    <h3>Monoclonal Antibody (mAB) Treatments</h3>
                    <p>Monoclonal antibodies are lab-made variants of the antibodies naturally made by our body 
                    to fight foreign particles, such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The mAB treatment is likely to 
                    reduce the chances of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Convalescent Plasma Therapy</h3>
                    <p>People who have already recovered from the coronavirus infection develop antibodies in 
                    their blood that helped them fight the virus and recover. Convalescent plasma therapy 
                    uses the blood products (plasma) of the recovered patients to treat coronavirus-infected 
                    people. It is safe and widely used.</p>
